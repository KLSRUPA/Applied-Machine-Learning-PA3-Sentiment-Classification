## PA3 Title: Sentiment Classification: Developing a Text Classification System for Birch

### Description:
In this project, I developed a performant text classification system for the company "Birch." I focused on understanding and implementing key components such as feature representation, processing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The project involved handling crowdsourced and gold-standard data for sentiment analysis. I aimed to ensure transparency, optimal performance, and robustness of the system. Key tasks included data annotation reflection, label distribution analysis, classifier implementation, and comparative performance evaluation between crowdsourced and gold data. The project culminated in a comprehensive technical report to facilitate future development and deployment.
